Add vanilla and vinegar, and continue to mix on high until mixture is thick, glossy, and forms stiff peaks. | Transfer egg white mixture into a piping bag with a star tip. Pipe a circle about a 1/2 inch thick and 2 1/2 to 3 inches across.

Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until the berries are soft, but have not all completely fallen apart, and liquid is slightly reduced and syrupy. Remove from heat to cool, then refrigerate cranberry sauce until needed. | Whip heavy cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form; refrigerate until needed. | To assemble each tree, place largest meringue circle on the bottom. Cover with whipped cream, add a spoonful of cranberry sauce, and then sprinkle with chopped pistachios. Finish layer with a small dollop of whipped cream, and top with the second largest meringue circle. | Continue to build layers in the same order, using successively smaller circles each time, and ending with the smallest meringue kiss. Repeat with remaining ingredients to assemble all 6 trees. | Drip additional cranberry sauce down the sides, if desired, for a nicer look, then sprinkle with powdered sugar.John MitzewichChef's Notes:Cream of tartar is optional, but highly recommended—it will help stabilize the meringue.For an interactive experience, all the components can be made and set up on a table, and guests can build their own trees.Trees are best assembled and served the same day meringues are made, since they will eventually absorb moisture from the air and get sticky. Refrigerate in an airtight container if making ahead.Any tart fruit sauce can be used, including leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving.",45 mins,1 hr 25 mins,3 hrs 10 mins,6,

Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 3/8-inch thickness. Season lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper. | With the smoother side of chicken breasts facing up, lay 2 to 4 sage leaves on each breast; more sage leaves will give a stronger sage flavor. Then, cover breasts with a single layer of prosciutto, covering the sage underneath. | Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top, and press down firmly to flatten. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes before cooking for best results. | Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken, prosciutto-side down. in the pan, and sear until prosciutto is lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Turn chicken over, and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 3 minutes more. Exact time will depend on size and thickness of chicken breasts. | Turn off heat, remove chicken to a plate, and cover loosely with foil. | For the sauce, add Marsala, lemon juice, and chicken broth to the pan, along with any accumulated juices from the plate with chicken, and place back over medium-high heat.

Or, after chicken is cooked, the sage can simply be fried in the pan until crisp and used to top the plate.",10 mins,10 mins,50 mins,2,

Cook over hot coals with the cover on, adjusting the vents to keep the heat down, until skin has a little color, about 4 minutes.

You will likely have to pull the chicken off the grill when the breast meat is slightly overcooked, and the leg meat is slightly undercooked. For all the meat to be perfectly cooked, you will need to separate the pieces.You can use the same basic vinegar and butter marinade, but change the spices to create different flavor profiles.",15 mins,50 mins,5 hrs 5 mins,4,
